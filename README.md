<h3>Git Basics</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775">Git and GitHub</a></h4>
The Udacity course get me a more comprehensive knowledge of how is git working. In my opinion, it's necessary to know how your working tools work inside.

The visualization of the git branches allows me to imagine how it's look like 100% clear. Also, I never work with git rebase before. It’s a great way to take commit tree more readable.

## Git Collaboration

It tells in detail why you need a git, where you can use it in real life. Very cool! It’s a pity that I didn’t see this course at the very beginning of my acquaintance with git, he scared me like any newcomer. Nothing new for me.
